            <h1>OUR BRAND</h1>
            DEMECON specializes in the mitigation and management of the significant risks associated with large complex Deconstruction and Demolition projects.
            These include Physical, Financial, as well as Reputational risks.

            Our focus is to work with your Management Teams, in order to ensure that ALL elements of the Demolition Phase are comprehensively planned, priced and scheduled.

            The catalyst for DEMECON’s formation was the increasing number of high-profile incidents on major projects; where the absence of proper planning & execution skills, necessary for complicated Demolition works, is manifest.

            Construction & Demolition are not mutually exclusive.
            DEMECON wants to ensure that appropriate consideration is given to the (often overlooked) aspects of high-risk Demolition work; such that the overall Construction Project has an increased chance of total success, as well as the best possible Safety outcomes.

            By providing comprehensive technical inputs and innovative Demolition solutions, we strive to provide your project with a true technical advantage and firmly believe that we can negate scope-creep, schedule blow-outs and cost-overrun.

        From 2015 to 2018, our Directors were privileged to plan and manage the safe execution of a highly complex, industrial Demolition project in the Melbourne metropolitan area.

        This project entailed the removal of a significantly deteriorated steel & concrete structure (the equivalent of a 30-storey building) within a fully operational Major-Hazard Facility.
        
        The technical solution in this instance, involved the utilisation of the World’s largest Heavy-Lift Luffing (HLL) Tower Crane, along with several innovative techniques to dismantle, as well as process significantly large structural components and vessels. The largest single complex lift, executed within an extremely limited operating footprint, was circa 195 tonne.
        
        Over a period of 24 months, more than 100,000 man-hours of extremely challenging de-commissioning, deconstruction & demolition procedures (not previously undertaken in Australia) were conducted without any safety incidents whatsoever.
        
        We enabled the project to be delivered in a timely manner, with a perfect safety record and within 3% of a budget to which we had committed four years previously.
        
        For this undertaking our Director received a Fuelling Victoria Award for Outstanding Contribution.
